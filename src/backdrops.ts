 * used to be offered density and rotation whatever it did with them, and a
 * second pitch only if it was one of two named in a set — so `checks` offered
 * a line width it never draws, and adding a pattern meant remembering to edit
 * that set somewhere else.
 *
 * `tile` is the pattern's repeat in world units, along the ruling and across
 * it, given the two pitches. A swatch is repeated as a tile, so it has to be
 * framed on exactly this or it will not meet its own edge — and several of
 * these are irrational against the spacing (`grid` at root two, `hexagons` at
 * root three), which is why the frame is computed rather than assumed square.
