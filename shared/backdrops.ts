/**
 * What a zone's cell is ruled with, behind its cards. `none` draws nothing and
 * `solid` a flat tint; the rest are line art, ruled in world space so they read
 * at one density across the wall.
 *
 * Shared rather than client-side because a zone may override the wall's choice,
 * and the daemon holds that override — see `server/zones.ts`. How each one is
 * drawn stays with the drawing: `src/backdrops.ts` for the shader, `Minimap`
 * for the ones SVG can.
