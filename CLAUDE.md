`DESIGN.md` is the design doc — what the wall is, what is decided, what is open.
`README.md` is the stranger's entry point.

## The daemon does not reload. Check it before you debug it.

The daemon and the client run as **LaunchAgents** — `tech.michaelbaker.slopboard.daemon`
and `.client` — detached, with `KeepAlive`, started with no `watch`. So the
daemon goes on serving whatever build it was launched from however many times
`server/` or `shared/` changes, and every symptom of that reads as a broken
feature rather than as a stale process: a field the daemon has never heard of is
dropped from a patch without a word.

**Before debugging anything that crosses the daemon, run `npm run doctor`.** It
prints what holds each port, when it started, and whether the daemon's build
matches this checkout. `npm run daemon:restart` kickstarts it.

The wall says so too: the band shows a `daemon stale` chip when the build the
daemon started from disagrees with its code on disk (`/api/code`). Both are the
last commit touching `server/`, `shared/` or the package files, so a
client-only commit never trips it. Vite reloads itself, so the client half is
never the stale one.

`npm run dev` refuses to start a second daemon behind the LaunchAgent rather
than dying with `EADDRINUSE` where the message scrolls past.
